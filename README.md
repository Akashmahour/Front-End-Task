# Front-End-Task
You are required to create the landing page only. Please use opensource coincap api’s to fetch
the list of cryptocurrencies and render them in a table as the original website. You do not
have to expand the rows as per original design. However, you are required to perform
pagination with page size 50 i.e., only 50 currencies should be visible in the table initially and
next50 should be loaded on clicking the ‘load more’ button.
Complete details of the API are present here.
API to fetch list of currencies -> https://api.coincap.io/v2/assets
The api will not give the icon for each currency. Please use this URL to fetch the icon of the
currency -> https://assets.coincap.io/assets/icons/<lowercase of currency symbol>@2x.png
For example, sumbol for Ethereum is ETH so the url of icon will be
https://assets.coincap.io/assets/icons/eth@2x.png
You are free to make any assumptions that are not defined in the above guidelines.
Please share the git url of the final code post completion and deploy it on Heroku if possible.
Detailed description of the APIs are on below URL.
